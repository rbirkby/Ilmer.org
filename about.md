### Acknowledgements

### The Name

As late as 1949, the Bucks Herald still occasionally referred to Ilmer as Ilmire. 

For example, from their March 22nd 1924 issue:

^HIGHWAYS COMMITTEE - Mr. Robert Bailey wrote, on behalf of the Ilmire parish meeting, drawing attention to a danger existing at the corner near the pond on Ilmire Church road, and asking that a part of the pond be filled in. The Surveyor was instructed to report on the matter at the next meeting
