Lockington, or sometimes Lookington, was situated south-east of Ilmer in what is now a copse by the side of a footpath.

[Census records](http://www.saunderton.demon.co.uk/basic_saunderton/pdf/lockington%20all%20years.pdf) for 1841 show 22 inhabitants in 5 dwellings comprising 11 members of the Allen family, 2 Roberts, a Gregory, 3 Burnhams and 5 Watsons living in Lockington.

By 1851, the number of inhabitants was 23 with 13 Allens remaining in addition to 5 Burnhams and 5 Bass, all living in the 5 houses.

In the 1861 census, there were 33 people living in 4 properties with just 2 Allens remaining, but now there were 17 Kinghams, 6 Burnhams, 6 Canes, a Beach and a Gunnell.

Most were either lace makers or agricultural labourers.

Old maps show 2 wells within the curtilage of the hamlet. They are both easy to find. One of the wells is situated inside what remains of the walls of a dwelling.

During the 20th century, Charlie Belgrove lived here. The Bucks Herald described him being inside a hut when they went to interview him. Could this be it?

Nearby is another well, this time about 5 foot in diameter with an old kitchen stove falling in.
