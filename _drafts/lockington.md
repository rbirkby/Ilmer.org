Lockington, or sometimes Lookington, was situated south-east of Ilmer in what is now a copse by the side of a footpath.
All that is left is a pond, what remains of a building and a section of wall.

Census records record various members of the Gomme family residing here. During the 20th century, Charlie Belgrove lived here.
