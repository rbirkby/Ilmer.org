The farms in the village have come and gone, and changed names too.

* Lower Farm
* Ilmer House Farm
* Ilmer Farm
* Manor Farm
* Severalles
* Upper Manor Farm
* Upper Farm
* Lower House Farm
* Cold Harbour Farm

### Severalles / Lower Farm / Lower House Farm

George Kingham was farmer of Lower Farm in 1903.

Thomas Bradshaw farmed at Lower Farm until 1922 when he sold up. Milk production continued until 1944 by Stanley Claridge who, along with his son William, then stopped milk production at the farm. The Bucks Herald noted 3 years earlier that William was fined 20s for "causing an obstruction with a motor car" in the market square in Aylesbury on October 11th.

One is probably content that the Bucks Herald no longer list minor motoring offences for posterity...

William was also convicted the same year of selling "adulterated milk".

Stanley died aged 66 in August 1947, 3 months after his wife passed.

After his father died, William built up a poultry flock, but neglected to send his eggs to the official ministry of food approved package station. The law caught up with him in 1949 when he was fined £20 and £6 5s costs for selling 104 dozen eggs illegally.

Despite these convictions, the prosecutor described it as "an isolated act of foolishness".


### Upper Manor Farm / Ilmer House Farm / Upper Farm

Upper Farm was let to Mr Belgrove in 1882.

David Goodchild, farmer died 1886 aged 55.

Ilmer House was the farming residence for land around the south-eastern area of Ilmer. The house was constructed around 1906 by Albert Goodchild who lived there with his wife and daughter Millicent Irene. Albert may also have had a son - Robert Douglas.

The misdemeanors described above weren't confined to Lower Farm. Albert was fined 5s in 1929 for killing game with a gun without a licence (on a Sunday!).

In 1931, Albert died aged 58 and the following year the house was put up for auction. It was described in the Bucks Herald's May 27 issue as:

> 275 feet up, with S.E. and S.W. aspects, Vestibule and Hall, 3 Reception Rooms, Billiard Room, Study, 10 Bed and Dressing Rooms, 2 Bathrooms, Offices, Own Electric Light and Water, Central Heating, Modern Drainage, Lavatory Basins in Bedrooms, Garage, Two Cottages, excellent Farm Buildings. Deligtful[sic] Gardens with Tennis and Croquet Lawns in all about 116 acres with Vacant Posession of House, Farm Buildings, 1 Cottage and Garden. Hunting with the South Oxfordshire, Old Berkeley, Bicester etc

A Mr W White is recorded as being resident in the house until about 1936 followed by a Robert Attenborough who died in 1968.

During the 1970s, a new farm residence was constructed - what is now Upper Manor Farm which allowed Ilmer House to part ways with its farmland.
