The 1968 film starring Dick Van Dyke had a memorable scene filmed at the railway bridge. Watch it again to see how little has changed!

Adjacent to the bridge was Ilmer Halt, an on request station where a telephone was used to ask for the next train to stop at the halt. The station was opened 1st April 1929 serving the London and North-Eastern Railway Company. Initially, 1 northboard and 1 southbound train stopped here every morning on weekdays. Ilmer Halt can be seen in this still image taken from a [train cab video](http://youtu.be/nyWkpteoa84?t=39s) in 1962. The station closed the following year:
